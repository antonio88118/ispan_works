            While listening to this record I envisioned riding on a riverboat late at night between two bright cities,  dancing beneath the string lights along the deck as the boat drifts across the river, the water gleaming with each rise and fall in the thousands of tiny waves. This album is like the end credits of someone who lived a fun, carefree life. With musical elements of decades past while still sounding modern and fresh as each track passes.

            blink-182's legendary, generation-defining lineup finally returns; as someone who has been an avid super fan of the band for many years, and also a big defender of the three Matt Skiba-era records (I count California deluxe as a sister album to the original rather than simply an extension), I never quite expected Tom DeLonge to ever return to the band, given the nature of his continued fall-outs with Mark Hoppus and Travis Barker. I had of course hoped for long it might happen but accepted the chances were near-zero and was simply grateful that a band I loved so much was still able to continue in any form, especially given what a rollercoaster their career had turned into from the self-titled album and beyond, and I was appreciative for the new twists and sounds that Skiba brought to the table.
